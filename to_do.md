### To Do

✓ Fade out after timing of song  
☐  After fade, show some message  
--- "END OF LINE" in Tron blue color, terminal text  
----- make this appear as if it's typed  
--- *or* SEE YOU SPACE COWBOY in bottom right, Cheltenham Bold Condensed or ITC    
☐ Trim mp3 to remove junk at the end  
☐ Adjust fadeOut timing to match trimmed mp3  
☐ Fade *in* to match intro / pretty quick  
☐ Select a random gif from a collection of a few different outrun items
